# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book covers using R for doing optimization, a key area of operations research, which has been applied to virtually every industry. The current focus is on linear and mixed integer optimization. In the future it may grow to include a broader range of Operations Research methods. \vspace{12pt}

Pedagogically, since the late 1990s, I had been a proponent of teaching introductory optimization using spreadsheets as a way to bridge the barrier between data and applications as well as teaching better spreadsheet practices. While this worked well, the disconnect with algebraic modeling was always a problem. Excel add-ins enabling algebraic tools were rich but not seamless. In 2018, I decided to switch to R for a variety of reasons:

-   With the rapid rise of interest in data analytics, it became important to introduce a data analytics platform.
-   Working technology and business professionals should have an awareness of the tools and langauge of data analytis to deal with consultants, data scientists, and others.
-   New software and extensions reduced the barrier to entry for people to start using data analytics tools.

This book has been used multiple times for a ten week graduate course on operations research emphasizing optimization. It can be used for graduate and undergraduate courses for people without a background in optimization and varying levels of mathematical backgrounds. The focus is on applications (formulating, implementing, and interpreting rather than algorithms. The book could be used as a supplement in a more theoretical or algorithm-oriented class. Key principles in the development of the book include the following:

-   An assumption the reader is willing to use R and getting their hands dirty with experimenting.
-   Providing and explaining code, sometimes repeated in different places so that examples are relatively clear and self-contained.
-   Creating algebraic formulations before implementing.
-   An emphasis on application rather than algorithmic details.
-   Embodying the philosophy of reproducible research - the book is regularly rebuilt with all analyses automatically rerun and most tables and figures rebuilt.
-   Contributing to the open source community - all materials are available on the author's github repository.
-   Demonstrating common debugging practices with a troubleshooting emphasis specific to optimization using R.\
-   Providing code chunks liberally that readers can adopt and adapt to their own applications.
