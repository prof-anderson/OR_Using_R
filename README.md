# OR(Operation Research)

Operations research (OR) is an analytical approach of problem-solving and decision-making that is useful in the management of organizations. In operations research, problems are broken down into primary elements and then solved in described steps by way of mathematical analysis.
1.The process of operations research can be broadly broken down into the following steps:
2.Identifying a trouble that desires to be solved.
3.Constructing a mannequin round the trouble that resembles the actual world and variables.
4.Using the mannequin to derive options to the problem.
5.Testing every answer on the mannequin and examining its success.
6.Implementing the answer to the authentic problem.

configuration: Generally, a configuration is the arrangement - or the process of making the arrangement - of the parts that make up a whole

# What is R?
R is a programming language and free software program developed via Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993. R possesses an widespread catalog of statistical and graphical methods. It consists of computing device getting to know algorithms, linear regression, time series, statistical inference to identify a few. Most of the R libraries are written in R, however for heavy computational tasks, C, C++ and Fortran codes are preferred.

Program: R is a clear and handy programming tool
Transform: R is made up of a series of libraries designed mainly for information science
Discover: Investigate the data, refine your speculation and analyze them
Model: R affords a huge array of equipment to seize the proper mannequin for your data
Communicate: Integrate codes, graphs, and outputs to a file with R Markdown or construct Shiny apps to share with the world
